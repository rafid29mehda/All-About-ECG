## **What is an ECG?**  
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a graph that records the heart’s electrical activity using electrodes placed on the skin[2][17]. Imagine your heart as a pump powered by tiny electrical signals. These signals cause the heart muscles to contract and relax, pumping blood throughout your body. The ECG captures these electrical changes as waves, helping doctors check if your heart is working properly[2][18].

## **The ECG Waveform: Breaking It Down**  
A typical ECG waveform has five main components: **P wave, QRS complex, T wave, U wave**, and specific intervals (**PR, QT, ST**). Let’s explore each part step-by-step.  

---

### **1. P Wave: The Atrial Contraction Signal**  
The **P wave** is the first small upward bump on the ECG. It represents the electrical activation of the *atria* (the heart’s upper chambers)[1][15].  

#### **Characteristics & Significance**  
- **Shape**: Smooth and rounded, like a hill[1][15].  
- **Duration**: ≤ 0.12 seconds (3 small squares on ECG paper)[1][9].  
- **Amplitude**: ≤ 2.5 mm tall in limb leads (e.g., leads I, II)[1][15].  
- **Direction**: Positive (upward) in leads I, II, and V4–V6[15].  

**Example**: If the P wave is **notched** (split into two peaks), it might indicate atrial enlargement[1]. A **missing P wave** could mean the electrical signal isn’t starting in the sinoatrial node (e.g., atrial fibrillation)[17].  

---

### **2. QRS Complex: The Ventricular Contraction Signal**  
The **QRS complex** is the tall spike following the P wave. It reflects the *ventricles* (lower chambers) contracting to pump blood[6][18].  

#### **Morphology & Duration**  
- **Components**:  
  - **Q wave**: First downward deflection (if present).  
  - **R wave**: First upward deflection.  
  - **S wave**: Downward deflection after the R wave[6].  
- **Duration**: 0.08–0.10 seconds (2–2.5 small squares)[6]. A wider QRS (>0.12s) suggests delayed ventricular activation (e.g., bundle branch block)[6].  

**Example**: In a healthy heart, the QRS in lead II is tall and narrow. If it’s **wide and notched**, it could indicate a blockage in the heart’s electrical pathways[6].  

---

### **3. T Wave: The Ventricular Reset Signal**  
The **T wave** is a smaller upward wave after the QRS. It represents the ventricles *resetting* (repolarizing) for the next heartbeat[1][7].  

#### **Properties & Variations**  
- **Shape**: Asymmetrical—gentle upslope, steeper downslope[7][15].  
- **Amplitude**: ≤ 5 mm in limb leads, ≤ 10 mm in chest leads[15].  
- **Direction**: Upright in most leads (except aVR and V1)[7].  

**Abnormalities**:  
- **Peaked T waves**: May signal high potassium levels[7].  
- **Inverted T waves**: Can indicate heart muscle damage (e.g., heart attack)[7].  

---

### **4. U Wave: The Mystery Wave**  
The **U wave** is a rare, small bump after the T wave. Its origin is debated but may reflect repolarization of the heart’s Purkinje fibers[8].  

#### **Clinical Relevance**  
- **Prominent U waves**: Linked to low potassium, slow heart rates, or certain medications[8].  
- **Inverted U waves**: May suggest heart disease[8].  

**Example**: A tall U wave in a patient with fatigue could indicate hypokalemia (low potassium)[8].  

---

### **5. PR Interval: The Atrial-to-Ventricular Delay**  
The **PR interval** measures the time from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS[9][15]. It reflects how long the electrical signal takes to travel from the atria to the ventricles.  

#### **Normal Range & Measurement**  
- **Duration**: 0.12–0.20 seconds (3–5 small squares)[9][15].  
- **Prolonged PR (>0.20s)**: “First-degree heart block”—delayed signal through the AV node[9].  
- **Short PR (<0.12s)**: May indicate an abnormal electrical pathway (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)[9].  

**Example**: A PR interval of 0.22s suggests delayed conduction, often seen in older adults[9].  

---

### **6. QT Interval: The Ventricular Activity Timer**  
The **QT interval** measures the total time for ventricular depolarization *and* repolarization (from QRS start to T wave end)[10][11].  

#### **Corrected QT (QTc)**  
Since QT varies with heart rate, we calculate **QTc** to standardize it:  
$$
\text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}}
$$  
- **Normal QTc**: ≤ 0.44 seconds[11].  
- **Prolonged QTc**: Increases risk of dangerous arrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes)[10].  

**Example**: A patient with a QT of 0.48s and heart rate of 60 bpm (RR=1s) has QTc = 0.48s, indicating prolonged QT[11].  

---

### **7. ST Segment: The Ischemia Indicator**  
The **ST segment** is the flat line between the QRS and T wave. It reflects the ventricles’ early repolarization phase[12][15].  

#### **Analysis & Baseline Reference**  
- **Isoelectric baseline**: The ST segment should align with the TP segment (between T and P waves)[15].  
- **Elevation/depression**: ≥1 mm deviation from baseline suggests heart damage (e.g., heart attack)[12].  

**Example**: **ST elevation** in leads V2–V4 often indicates a blockage in the left anterior descending artery (a “widowmaker” heart attack)[12].  

---

### **8. J Point: The QRS End Marker**  
The **J point** is where the QRS complex meets the ST segment[13][15]. It marks the end of ventricular depolarization.  

#### **Significance**  
- **Elevated J point**: Seen in early repolarization (normal variant) or heart injury[13].  
- **Depressed J point**: May indicate ischemia[13].  

**Example**: A healthy athlete might have slight J-point elevation due to benign early repolarization[13].  

---

### **9. Isoelectric Line: The Silent Baseline**  
The **isoelectric line** is the flat baseline between waves, indicating no electrical activity[15][16]. It’s used as a reference to measure deviations in other waves.  

**Example**: If the ST segment is *above* the isoelectric line, it’s elevated—a sign of heart damage[15].  

---

### **10. Wave Amplitudes: Measuring Electrical Strength**  
- **P wave**: ≤2.5 mm in limb leads[15].  
- **QRS**: ≤25 mm in chest leads[15].  
- **T wave**: ≤5 mm in limb leads[15].  

**Example**: A **giant R wave** in V1–V3 may indicate right ventricular hypertrophy[6].  

---

## **Putting It All Together**  
Imagine an ECG from a healthy person:  
1. **P wave**: Small hill (0.10s) in lead II.  
2. **QRS**: Sharp spike (0.08s) with tall R waves.  
3. **T wave**: Rounded peak matching the QRS direction.  
4. **PR interval**: 0.16s.  
5. **QTc**: 0.40s.  

Abnormalities like a **missing P wave** (atrial fibrillation) or **ST elevation** (heart attack) stand out against this normal pattern.
