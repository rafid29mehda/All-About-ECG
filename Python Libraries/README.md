- Provides tools for plotting ECG signals and annotations.
- Handles sampling rate conversions and signal segmentation.
- Compatible with PhysioNet datasets like MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB-XL.

### ECG Applications
- Load ECG signals from PhysioNet databases for ML/DL research.

signal = record.p_signal[:, 0]  # Lead I
fs = record.fs  # Sampling rate (360 Hz)

# Load annotations
annotation = wfdb.rdann('mit-bih/100', 'atr', sampto=1000)
qrs_indices = annotation.sample
labels = annotation.symbol

# Plot
plt.plot(signal, label='ECG Lead I')

## End-to-End Example: Processing an ECG Signal

Let’s imagine you’re a PhD student analyzing an ECG from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to detect normal vs. abnormal beats using ML/DL. You’ll use the libraries above to preprocess and analyze the signal.

### Step 1: Load Data (WFDB)
- Load ECG and annotations:
  ```python
  import wfdb
  record = wfdb.rdrecord('mit-bih/100', sampto=10000)
  signal = record.p_signal[:, 0]  # Lead I
  fs = record.fs  # 360 Hz
  annotation = wfdb.rdann('mit-bih/100', 'atr', sampto=10000)
  qrs_indices = annotation.sample
  labels = annotation.symbol  # e.g., 'N' (normal), 'V' (PVC)
  ```

### Step 2: Preprocess (BioSPPy, SciPy, NumPy)
- **Filter Signal** (SciPy):
  ```python
  from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt
  def bandpass_filter(data, fs, lowcut=0.5, highcut=40):
      nyq = 0.5 * fs
      low = lowcut / nyq
      high = highcut / nyq
      b, a = butter(4, [low, high], btype='band')
      return filtfilt(b, a, data)
  signal_filtered = bandpass_filter(signal, fs)
  ```
- **Detect QRS Peaks** (BioSPPy):
  ```python
  from biosppy.signals import ecg
  ecg_out = ecg.ecg(signal=signal_filtered, sampling_rate=fs, show=False)
  r_peaks = ecg_out['rpeaks']
  ```
- **Normalize** (NumPy):
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  signal_norm = (signal_filtered - np.mean(signal_filtered)) / np.std(signal_filtered)
  ```

### Step 3: Denoise (PyWavelets)
- Apply wavelet denoising:
  ```python
  import pywt
  coeffs = pywt.wavedec(signal_norm, 'db4', level=4)
  threshold = np.std(coeffs[-1]) * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(len(signal_norm)))
  coeffs[1:] = [pywt.threshold(c, threshold, mode='soft') for c in coeffs[1:]]
  signal_denoised = pywt.waverec(coeffs, 'db4')
  ```

### Step 4: Extract Features (NeuroKit2)
- Analyze ECG features:
  ```python
  import neurokit2 as nk
  ecg_signals, info = nk.ecg_process(signal_denoised, sampling_rate=fs)
  rr_intervals = np.diff(info['ECG_R_Peaks']) / fs  # RR intervals in seconds
  ```

### Step 5: Visualize (Matplotlib)
- Plot the processed ECG:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot(signal_denoised, label='Denoised ECG')
  plt.plot(info['ECG_R_Peaks'], signal_denoised[info['ECG_R_Peaks']], 'ro', label='R Peaks')
  plt.title('Processed ECG with QRS Peaks')
  plt.xlabel('Sample')
  plt.ylabel('Normalized Amplitude')
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

### Step 6: Train a Model (TensorFlow)
- Prepare data and train a simple CNN:
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, Dense, Flatten

  # Segment ECG around R peaks (e.g., 200 samples per beat)
  segments = [signal_denoised[p-100:p+100] for p in info['ECG_R_Peaks'] if p >= 100 and p < len(signal_denoised)-100]
  X = np.array(segments)[:, :, np.newaxis]  # Shape: (n_segments, 200, 1)
  y = np.array([1 if l == 'V' else 0 for l in labels[:len(segments)]])  # 0=normal, 1=PVC

  # Build CNN
  model = Sequential([
      Conv1D(32, 5, activation='relu', input_shape=(200, 1)),
      Flatten(),
      Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])

  # Train
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(X, y, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
  ```

### Step 7: Summarize
- **Findings**: The ECG was loaded (WFDB), filtered (SciPy), QRS peaks detected (BioSPPy), denoised (PyWavelets), features extracted (NeuroKit2), visualized (Matplotlib), and used to train a CNN (TensorFlow).
