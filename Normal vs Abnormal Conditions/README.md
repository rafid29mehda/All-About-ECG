# Normal and Abnormal ECG Conditions for Biomedical Signal Processing

## Part 1: Normal ECG Scenario

### What is a Normal ECG?
A **normal ECG** reflects a healthy heart’s electrical activity, showing a consistent pattern of waves and intervals that indicate proper atrial and ventricular function. It’s like a well-rehearsed orchestra playing a predictable melody, with each section (atria, ventricles) performing in sync.

### Physiological Basis
The ECG records electrical impulses generated by the heart:
- **Sinoatrial (SA) Node**: The heart’s pacemaker, initiating each heartbeat in the right atrium.
- **Atrial Depolarization**: Electrical spread through atria, causing contraction.
- **Atrioventricular (AV) Node**: Delays impulse to allow ventricular filling.
- **Ventricular Depolarization**: Electrical spread through ventricles, causing contraction.
- **Ventricular Repolarization**: Recovery phase as ventricles reset.

### Normal ECG Components
A normal ECG consists of waves, segments, and intervals, typically measured in **Lead II** (clear P waves) or across 12 leads for comprehensive analysis:
1. **P Wave**:
   - **Physiology**: Atrial depolarization.
   - **Appearance**: Small, rounded, positive in Lead II.
   - **Duration**: 80–120 ms (0.08–0.12 s).
   - **Amplitude**: <0.25 mV (2.5 mm at 10 mm/mV calibration).
2. **PR Interval**:
   - **Physiology**: Time from atrial depolarization to ventricular depolarization (includes AV node delay).
   - **Measurement**: From P wave start to QRS start.
   - **Duration**: 120–200 ms (0.12–0.2 s).
3. **QRS Complex**:
   - **Physiology**: Ventricular depolarization.
   - **Components**:
     - **Q Wave**: Small downward deflection (first negative wave, not always present).
     - **R Wave**: Tall, positive peak.
     - **S Wave**: Downward deflection after R.
   - **Duration**: 60–120 ms (0.06–0.12 s).
   - **Amplitude**: Varies by lead (e.g., 0.5–2 mV in Lead II).
4. **ST Segment**:
   - **Physiology**: Ventricles fully depolarized, before repolarization.
   - **Appearance**: Flat, at baseline (isoelectric line, between T and P waves).
   - **Duration**: ~80–120 ms.
5. **T Wave**:
   - **Physiology**: Ventricular repolarization.
   - **Appearance**: Positive, asymmetric (gentle upslope, steeper downslope) in Lead II.
   - **Amplitude**: <0.5 mV in limb leads, <1 mV in precordial leads (V1–V6).
6. **QT Interval**:
   - **Physiology**: Total time for ventricular depolarization and repolarization.
   - **Measurement**: From Q start to T end.
   - **Duration**: 350–440 ms (varies with heart rate).
   - **Corrected QT (QTc)**: Adjusted for heart rate using Bazett’s formula:
     \[
     QTc = \frac{QT}{\sqrt{RR}}
     \]
     Normal: 360–440 ms (men), 360–460 ms (women).
7. **RR Interval**:
   - **Physiology**: Time between consecutive R peaks, reflecting heart rate.
   - **Calculation**: Heart rate = 60 / RR (in seconds).
   - **Normal Heart Rate**: 60–100 beats/min (bpm).

### Normal ECG Characteristics
- **Rhythm**: Regular, with consistent RR intervals (normal sinus rhythm, NSR).
- **P Wave Presence**: Present before each QRS, consistent shape.
- **QRS Morphology**: Narrow, consistent across beats.
- **ST Segment**: Isoelectric (no elevation/depression >1 mm).
- **T Wave**: Concordant with QRS (e.g., positive in leads with positive QRS).
- **Lead Patterns**: Expected variations across 12 leads (e.g., R wave progression in V1–V6).

### Why It’s Important for Research
- Understanding normal ECGs establishes a baseline for detecting abnormalities.
- Normal features (e.g., RR intervals, QRS duration) are used in ML/DL models to distinguish healthy vs. diseased states.
- Normal ECGs in datasets (e.g., PhysioNet’s NSRDB) train models for classification.

**Example**: A normal ECG is like a steady drumbeat (QRS) with soft intro notes (P waves) and smooth transitions (ST, T), played at a calm tempo (60–100 bpm).

## Part 2: Abnormal ECG Conditions

Abnormal ECGs reflect disruptions in the heart’s electrical or structural function, caused by conditions like ischemia, arrhythmias, or structural damage. Below, I’ll cover key abnormalities, starting with **myocardial infarction (MI)** in depth, followed by other major conditions relevant to ECG analysis in biomedical signal processing.

### 1. Myocardial Infarction (MI)

#### What is Myocardial Infarction?
MI, or heart attack, occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, reducing blood flow to part of the heart muscle (myocardium), causing tissue damage or death. It’s like a city block losing power, affecting the heart’s electrical “grid.”

#### Physiological Basis
- **Cause**: Plaque rupture in a coronary artery forms a clot, blocking blood flow.
- **Effects**:
  - **Ischemia**: Reduced oxygen causes reversible injury.
  - **Infarction**: Prolonged ischemia leads to irreversible muscle death.
- **Regions Affected**: Depend on the artery (e.g., left anterior descending → anterior wall).
- **Types**:
  - **STEMI**: ST-elevation MI, full-thickness damage, complete artery occlusion.
  - **NSTEMI**: Non-ST-elevation MI, partial damage, partial occlusion.

#### ECG Features of MI
1. **Acute Phase (Minutes to Hours)**:
   - **ST Elevation**:
     - >1 mm (0.1 mV) in ≥2 contiguous leads (e.g., II, III, aVF for inferior MI).
     - Convex or “tombstone” shape.
     - Reflects transmural ischemia.
   - **Hyperacute T Waves**:
     - Tall, peaked T waves before ST elevation.
     - Early sign of ischemia.
   - **Reciprocal ST Depression**:
     - Opposite leads show ST depression (e.g., I, aVL for inferior MI).
     - Confirms acute injury.
2. **Evolving Phase (Hours to Days)**:
   - **Q Waves**:
     - Pathological Q waves (>40 ms or >25% of R wave height).
     - Indicate necrosis (dead tissue).
     - Appear within hours, persist lifelong.
   - **ST Elevation Reduces**:
     - ST returns toward baseline as injury resolves.
   - **T Wave Inversion**:
     - T waves flip negative in affected leads.
     - Reflects reperfusion or ongoing ischemia.
3. **Chronic Phase (Weeks to Years)**:
   - **Persistent Q Waves**:
     - Permanent marker of prior MI.
   - **Normalized ST/T**:
     - ST segment and T waves may return to normal or remain abnormal.

#### Lead-Specific Patterns
- **Inferior MI** (right coronary artery):
  - ST elevation in II, III, aVF.
  - Reciprocal ST depression in I, aVL.
- **Anterior MI** (left anterior descending artery):
  - ST elevation in V1–V4.
  - Reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads.
- **Lateral MI** (circumflex artery):
  - ST elevation in I, aVL, V5–V6.
  - Reciprocal changes in V1–V3.
- **Posterior MI** (right coronary or circumflex):
  - ST depression in V1–V3 (mirror of posterior ST elevation).
  - Tall R waves in V1–V2.

#### Diagnostics
- **Criteria**: ST Elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads + clinical symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) + elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin).
- **Timing**: ECG changes evolve over time, requiring serial ECGs.
- **Challenges**:
  - Noise/artifacts mimic ST elevation.
  - Conditions like pericarditis cause diffuse ST elevation, mimicking MI.
  - Bundle branch blocks obscure ST changes.

#### Signal Processing Relevance
- **Features for ML/DL**:
  - ST segment amplitude, Q wave duration, T wave inversion.
  - Time-series analysis of ST evolution.
  - Multi-lead correlation (e.g., reciprocal changes).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Band-pass filter (0.5–40 Hz) to enhance ST/QRS.
  - Baseline correction to measure ST accurately.
- **Applications**:
  - Real-time STEMI detection in wearable devices.
  - Automated MI classification using CNNs on datasets like PTB-XL.

**Example**: An MI ECG is like a power outage in a city. The lights flicker high (ST elevation), some go out permanently (Q waves), and the grid rewires oddly (T inversion).

## End-to-End Example: Analyzing ECG for Normal and Abnormal Conditions

Let’s imagine you’re a PhD student analyzing an ECG from the PTB-XL database to detect normal vs. abnormal conditions, including MI, using Python with `wfdb`, `neurokit2`, `numpy`, and `scipy`.

### Step 1: Load Data (WFDB)
- Load ECG and metadata:
  ```python
  import wfdb
  record = wfdb.rdrecord('ptb-xl/00100_hr', sampto=5000)  # 500 Hz, 10 seconds
  signal = record.p_signal[:, 1]  # Lead II
  fs = record.fs  # 500 Hz
  ```

### Step 2: Preprocess Signal (SciPy)
- Apply band-pass and notch filters:
  ```python
  from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt, iirnotch
  def preprocess_ecg(data, fs):
      # Band-pass filter (0.5–40 Hz)
      nyq = 0.5 * fs
      b, a = butter(4, [0.5/nyq, 40/nyq], btype='band')
      data = filtfilt(b, a, data)
      # Notch filter (60 Hz)
      b, a = iirnotch(60, 30, fs)
      return filtfilt(b, a, data)
  signal_clean = preprocess_ecg(signal, fs)
  ```

### Step 3: Fiducial Point Detection (NeuroKit2)
- Detect P, QRS, T waves:
  ```python
  import neurokit2 as nk
  ecg_signals, info = nk.ecg_process(signal_clean, sampling_rate=fs)
  p_peaks = info['ECG_P_Peaks']
  r_peaks = info['ECG_R_Peaks']
  q_peaks = info['ECG_Q_Peaks']
  s_peaks = info['ECG_S_Peaks']
  t_peaks = info['ECG_T_Peaks']
  ```

### Step 4: Feature Extraction (NumPy)
- Measure intervals and morphology:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  rr_intervals = np.diff(r_peaks) / fs  # Seconds
  pr_intervals = (q_peaks - p_peaks) / fs
  qrs_durations = (s_peaks - q_peaks) / fs
  qt_intervals = (t_peaks - q_peaks) / fs
  qtc = np.mean(qt_intervals) / np.sqrt(np.mean(rr_intervals))  # Bazett’s
  st_values = []
  q_amplitudes = []
  for r, q, s in zip(r_peaks, q_peaks, s_peaks):
      # ST deviation (60 ms after J point)
      j_point = s + int(0.04 * fs)
      st_point = j_point + int(0.06 * fs)
      if st_point < len(signal_clean):
          baseline = np.mean(signal_clean[r-50:r-10])
          st_values.append(signal_clean[st_point] - baseline)
      # Q wave amplitude
      if not np.isnan(q):
          q_amplitudes.append(np.min(signal_clean[int(q-10):int(q+10])))
  ```

### Step 5: Diagnostic Rules for Normal vs. Abnormal
- Apply rules:
  ```python
  diagnosis = []
  heart_rate = 60 / np.mean(rr_intervals)
  rr_var = np.std(rr_intervals)
  # Normal checks
  if (60 <= heart_rate <= 100 and 
      0.12 <= np.nanmean(pr_intervals) <= 0.2 and 
      np.nanmean(qrs_durations) <= 0.12 and 
      0.36 <= qtc <= 0.44 and 
      np.all(np.abs(st_values) < 0.1) and 
      rr_var < 0.1 and 
      len(p_peaks) > 0.9 * len(r_peaks)):
      diagnosis.append('Normal Sinus Rhythm')
  # MI checks
  if np.mean(st_values) > 0.1:  # ST elevation >1 mm
      diagnosis.append('Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)')
  if np.any(np.array(q_amplitudes) < -0.25 * np.mean(signal_clean[r_peaks])):  # Pathological Q
      diagnosis.append('Prior MI')
  # Arrhythmia checks
  if rr_var > 0.1 and len(p_peaks) < 0.5 * len(r_peaks):
      diagnosis.append('Atrial Fibrillation')
  if np.any(qrs_durations > 0.12) and len(p_peaks) < 0.5 * len(r_peaks):
      diagnosis.append('PVC')
  # Conduction checks
  if np.nanmean(pr_intervals) > 0.2:
      diagnosis.append('First-Degree AV Block')
  # QT checks
  if qtc > 0.44:
      diagnosis.append('Long QT')
  print(f"Diagnosis: {diagnosis if diagnosis else 'No clear abnormality'}")
  ```

### Step 6: Visualize (Matplotlib)
- Plot ECG with annotations:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot(signal_clean, label='Filtered ECG')
  plt.plot(p_peaks, signal_clean[p_peaks], 'go', label='P Peaks')
  plt.plot(r_peaks, signal_clean[r_peaks], 'ro', label='R Peaks')
  plt.plot(t_peaks, signal_clean[t_peaks], 'bo', label='T Peaks')
  plt.title('ECG Analysis for Normal/Abnormal Conditions')
  plt.xlabel('Sample')
  plt.ylabel('Amplitude (mV)')
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

### Step 7: Summarize
- **Findings**: The ECG was preprocessed, fiducial points detected, and features extracted (RR, PR, QRS, QT, ST, Q waves). Diagnostic rules identified normal or abnormal conditions (e.g., MI, AF, PVC).
- **Outcome**: Features and diagnoses are ready for ML/DL (e.g., training a CNN for MI detection).
- **Next Steps**: Use PTB-XL dataset to train a model or analyze multi-lead ECGs for lead-specific MI patterns.
